# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard was built to check the current weather in any city throughout the world, it is meant to help usera find out how the wetaher is going to be today and to have a 5 day forecast, either at their city or any other city that they might be traveling to or be curious about. The Weather Dashboard provided with challenges that I had not encountered before, one example was that I had not idea how to clear the divs before putting new informations in, this was a particular challenge because it turned out that I could fix it with one line of code in the display functions. This gave me the motivations to continuew working on it to be able to learn. I learnt a lot of JavaScript and how to add elements to HTML from it.

## Usage

If you want to check on a city that it on the search history, just click on the button and it'll the display the informattion again.
